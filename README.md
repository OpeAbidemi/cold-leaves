> Just testing how Apollo Federation works

Kinda loving the idea of subgraphs and supergraph ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹

Run this command to generate the supergraph

```sh
    yarn run generate:supergraph
```

Run this command to start the apollo server in dev mode

```sh
    yarn run dev
```

Am still gonna try with Type-Graphql
