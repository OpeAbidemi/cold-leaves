# Cold Leaves

> Just testing how Apollo Federation works

Kinda loving the idea of subgraphs and supergraph ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜‹

Run this command to generate the supergraph

```sh
    yarn run generate:supergraph
```

Run this command to start the apollo server in dev mode

```sh
    yarn run dev
```

Also tried this with typegraphql. Check it out [code-leaves-grande](https://github.com/OpeAbidemi/cold-leaves-grande)
